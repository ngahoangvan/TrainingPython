Give me a word with three consecutive double letters. I’ll give you a couple of words
that almost qualify, but don’t. For example, the word committee, c-o-m-m-i-t-t-e-e. It
would be great except for the ‘i’ that sneaks in there. Or Mississippi: M-i-s-s-i-s-s-ip-p-i.
If you could take out those i’s it would work. But there is a word that has three
consecutive pairs of letters and to the best of my knowledge this may be the only word.
Of course there are probably 500 more but I can only think of one. What is the word?
